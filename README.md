## 🎓 Quick Tutorial

### 1. Set Project Dimensions
- **Width/Length/Height** – Box size in cm or inches
- **Material Thickness** – Panel thickness in mm or inches
- **Outer Sizing** checkbox:
  - ✅ **Checked:** Dimensions include material (external measurements)
  - ❌ **Unchecked:** Dimensions are internal cavity size

### 2. Enable Sides

## 📐 Technical Details

### Coordinate Systems
Each side has its own 2D coordinate system with origin (0,0) at **top-left corner**:

- **Front/Back:** X = Width, Y = Height
- **Top/Bottom:** X = Width, Y = Length
- **Left/Right:** X = Height, Y = Length

**Learn more:** [Understanding 2D Coordinate Systems in MIDILLI Tools](https://midilli.tech/help-and-support/manuals/manuals-free-tools/understanding-2d-coordinate-systems-in-midilli-tools/)

### Data Storage
- All internal measurements stored in **centimeters**
- Material thickness and box height in **millimeters**
- JSON export preserves cm units for tool compatibility
- Display units (cm/inches) are UI-only conversions

### Component Properties
```json
{
  "call_name": "USB Port",
  "silkscreen_font_size": 12,
  "location_x": 5.0,
  "location_y": 3.0,
  "drill_width": 1.2,
  "drill_length": 0.8,
  "visible_width": 1.5,
  "visible_length": 1.0,
  "rotation": 45
}
```
